# TO DO
- Catch error if guild doesn't exist
- let command user know which players don't have data
- Fix additional argument parsing. Needs to be able to deal with multi word guild names
- instead of a parameter to get rid of times to make copying easier have reactions below message
- sort names based on time absent
- multiple pages if there are more than 25 people absent
- second page saying which if any were unable to have their data received (different color on the side and red x in front of their name)
- Fix issues with parameter parsing of guild names with more than one word






## Treasury Functionality

    - If you can't post a ss of the actual balance you need to post one of chat assigning the emeralds to yourself and type in your IGN -BAD OPTION

- Get balance
