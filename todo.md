# TO DO
- instead of a parameter to get rid of times to make copying easier have reactions below message
- sort names based on time absent
- multiple pages if there are more than 25 people absent
- second page saying which if any were unable to have their data received (different color on the side and red x in front of their name)
- Prevent names like _Wahoo_ from being interpreted as italic
- store guild object with player data in database & fetch it if query is made again within the hour
- additional info property that gets displayed when help is called on a specific command





## Treasury Functionality
