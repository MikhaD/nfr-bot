# TO DO
- instead of a parameter to get rid of times to make copying easier have reactions below message
- multiple pages if there are more than 25 people absent
- Failed page with names of players who's data failed to get retrieved on reacting to ‚ùó if there are failed players
- Prevent names like _Wahoo_ from being interpreted as italic
- store guild object with player data in database & fetch it if query is made again within the hour
- additional info property that gets displayed when help is called on a specific command
- replace objects in places like absences with maps
- if commands have required arguments, check for those in index
